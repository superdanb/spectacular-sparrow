          **Marketing in the real world** is very different than what we learn
          at school. If you've recently graduated and are making your first
          steps in the business, it's imperative that you know how to use the
          tools and tricks of the trade.


          > **The world of marketing has changed dramatically in the last 10
          years. Those who understand it, will succeed. But those who stay
          behind, will have a lot to catch up on.”**


          In this book I will teach you everything I know about B2B marketing.
          From branding, marketing planning, content creation, SEO and PPC, to
          segmenting your audience and understanding today's metrics and
          analytics methodologies — this guide is the only marketing education
          you'll ever need.
